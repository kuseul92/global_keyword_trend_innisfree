kalau dari segi menahan minyak dan kenyamanannya di kulit innisfree no 1 selanjutnya zero sebum karena dia lbh ngeringin dari innisfree tapi karena kulit jg sensitif sama agen penyumbat pori2 kaya silica mineral oil dan turunan2nya bedak berbasis corn starch lebih bersahabat buat sehari2 untuk marcks dia emg end bgt yah aplg buat kulit acne prone kaya kak ratu tapi kulitku sendiri cenderung kombinasi sensitif jd kalau keseringan pakai marcks kulitku perih kena salicylic acidnya dan bisa ngeringin jg makanya sejauh ini masih pakai yg wardah meskipun blm bisa dibilang bagus bgt tp buat kulit kombinasi sensitif dia oke krn ga ngeringin dan nyumbat porifinally ada yg ngebatttlllle iniiiikeep up good work ka ratuuuuushoot yg ketahanan innisfree depan maxx coffee bip ya kakkak review yg

tp emng bener jg setelah pake produk ini jd muncul jerawat baruharga emang menentukan kualitas xdkakak review wardah instaperfect cushion dongwell teh jg punya zero sebum dan dia ngiket minyak di muka bgt sih bisa seharian ga glowing gegara minyak dan dia transparan bgt memang ga ada coverage nya bahkan bedak baby pun masih lebih putih dr dia dan teh dia jg bisa buat di pake di rambut kalo rambut kita udah oily tp belum sempet atau males buat keramas dia bisa di pake di rambut di tap tap aja di rambut yg keliatan bgt oily trus sisir kalo bisa dr kulit kepala jd rata tp ga saranin buat to much ya kaya yg di bubuhin lgsg gtu itu ga bgt nanti kalo to much jd nya rambut kita kering dan malah bisa pagujid pas di sisir sangking kering nya bcs dulu pas peama coba gtu krn kebanyakan pake nya dan cuma di 1 titik di kepala malah jd kering bgt wkwk jd mgkn kalo teteh ga cocok buat di muka dan ga kepake lg bisa teteh pake di rambut kalo lg males agau belum sempet keramas happy tryingitu awet

udah setahun lebih pakai etude house zero sebum dan memang remended bgt sih untuk kulit oily dan untungnya selama setahun lebih itu ga ada masalah sih dgn jerawat setelah pake bedak iniq suka yg innisfreegw sampe skrg msh pake yg innisfree nosebum dan mnurut gw produknya bagus sih bisa nahan minyak cukup lama dan kalopun udh mulai berminyak muka ga lngsung kliatan glow sama minyak mukanya msh kliatan biasa aja tpi ttp aja kalo disentuh mukanya psti ada minyaknya gw jg suka baunya ada mint2 gitu jdi bikin seger yah so far so good sih utk muka oily kyk guenama ig kak ratu apa kakpurbasari

productos estar esperando la secci n de kbeautyvanevane si amas los productos coreanos te reiendo a glow recipe que tiene su negocio donde trae a us y tambi n creo que manda a otros pa ses puros productos coreanos yo ahorita la he reci n descubieo y estoy enamorada tienen un sistema de millas que seg n pres vas adquiriendo m s y te descuentan esas millas de 5 10 y as por d lar yo sigo el m todo coreano y le he incrementado los aceites porque son para m esenciales esto es lo que hago cleansing oil ese que te enron en b lsamo har lo mismo luego un jab n ph suave para el famoso doble limpieza que hacen pero solo lo hago en las noches despu s uso un toner un mist agua de esencia con el m todo de 7 pasos pat pat pat b scalo posteriormente pongo serum y ampoule si siento que necesito ambos tambi n pongo el aceite y hago facial fitness finalmente la crema de rostro y claro para los ojos el serum y crema de ojos todo esto lo hago de noches y en la ma ana lo repito pero no hago doble limpieza solo lavo con agua fr a y pat pat y luego el toner esencia pat pero no el m todo 7 sino 1 2 m ximo el serum el aceite si est seca sino voy directo a la crema y el spf que no puede faltar por supuesto el serum y crema de ojos de 1 3 a la semana hago exfoliaci n sencilla o ellos reiendan con discos suaves que tienen para ello o splah mask para exfoliar o duermo con un exfoliador tipo crema serum que transforma la cara hago rubber mask o use sheet masks un mont n si hago esto pues todo esto ir a con el pleto de noches el exfoliador luego del double cleansing y la mascarilla si es sheet luego de la esencia y si uno desea pone serum o ampoule porque ya quedas bastante bien si la mascarilla es para dormir la pongo en lugar de la crema otra cosita que he aprendido es a no usar toallas ni nada para la cara s es un truco que dan las chicas de glow recipe que al parecer hacen algunas coreanas porque el secar y colocar producto hace fricci n adem s de que por m s nueva que uses toalla para cara al diario no le hace bien lo he tratado y llevo casi un mes as o casi dos con k beauty y todos los trucos y mis alumnos me dicen que si me hice botox tengo 30 y de por s no ten a gran cosa o arrugas y as pero al vivir en el noe la cara se seca los granos por dry bination salen se ve opaca y no s que los productos coreanos me han salvado la vida claro que uso algunos que s puedo confiar o el serum de advanced de estee lauder que mencionaste y as pero en general la clave ha sido el k beauty y m s que nada hacer todos esos pasos ah y otra vez no secar cara sino retirar agua y todo lo que pongas siempre pat pat pat te dejo el de glow recipelos unico hauls q me gusta y los cuales siempres termino metia en las paginas prando son los tuyos me gusta o das tu opinion nunca cambies plisssamo

amazonthanks for i have similar skin tone to you but i also kind of understand why korean brands don t make colours too dark is because majority people re except for foreigners are pretty light toned innis and laneige are good innis good for a matte look laneige good for a dewy looki really really needed video thank you so so much i am a k beauty fan but i really thought i could never use cushions

foundation pact will be much more natural gives out natural glow and dewy finish after long wear although i know mary wise timewise is most effective but i am not able to afford kind of foundation tried it once though when i got chance hahaha sulwhasoo gives off korean vibe where ir face is kind off re is water mask layer on top laneige is natural as if like u don t wear make up at all and it is super good for normal outing sulwhasoo i can see myself buying probably for bigger ocassion or for my mumsame skin tone hi fivegreat info on all cushions i liked and subbedtoo bad none of se ship

someday thank yourip my bo sensitive skin guess i m not gonna try product still curious on cushion thoughthanks for helping me to savehi i am new in your channel and i really like your style for making review also i am a huge fan of innisfree and as i m an oily skin type i m looking forward for matte foundation but i wanted to see a review first and yours has really helped me thank youman foundation looked super promising toodamn as a person who has bination skin and living in a warm country is so not for me i seriously wanted to get because of concept but gosh nvm thank god i watched i should have watch before i purchased same thoughts and experience as yourshi came across your video after going to innisfree store today and am so so so so tempted to get one for myself salesgirl told me each range actually depends on type of skin i have dry oily bination thanks for ur review will definitely consider it before purchasing one for myself love many many choice of shades availablecan you do a review on lane blanc expe cushion we seem to have to have same skin type so i would be curious to hear your opinion on it everyone on internet was absolutely raving about it and ive tried it out myself and was kind of disappointed i would really be interested in seeing your reaction on keep up great videodoes have spf in it1st like ment i hope your day went well get enough rest thank you for review i m lowkey interested in foundation but n i m not since it s so oily and i don t have blotting sheets oh and i live in florida it s so humid here so uhmsooo funny but sooo seriously informative and honestif it s oily to you n what more if i wear it in a hot and humid countryi was so curious about foundation i am glad i decided to skip it my skin would be furious neverless it is a good idea thank you for your review you just saved me some trouble also i m loving yuzuru moment it cleared my soul love yaayay love review i ve been wondering if was woh it since i have bo oily skinhi howling i am wondering wher oily thingy came 4th level of coverage sometimes high coverage might break out our skin i have never try my foundation but i plan to try glow third level of coverage which is 3 3 can u give me some opinion since my foundation line was already launched half year ago u might know more about line already thanks yawhat brand of oil paper are you usingyou always seem to save me wasting money lmao i was so into after amazing review it got korean youtubers but now i know my oily skin just wont get along it so i m happy you uploaded before i purchased btw could you look into a pieu personal tone foundation it looks promising shade range is pretty good and i think it s not expensive at all toohey howling you should do a review on pore cleansing vacuum i don t know if you can get korea but i think it would be cool to see you doing review on love youi ordered in 1 5 and i had such high expectations for me i hope it s not as oily bc my skin is already super oily thanks for reviewi had such a big expectations towards foundation thank you for reviewyou got me excited for a second before i realized shade range of line was well 50 shades of beige lolol concept is really good but i don t know why it s so oily in end well it s a big no no for me as an oily skin type person thank u review love uthanks for review i m actually interested in foundation but finding english review is hard af tt didn t expect it to be sooo oily like 3 sheets of blotting papers not cool at all i hope y change formula to be less oily in future ttdid i see hanyu yuzurulol boom your face is goneits like 3am in my country right now hahahahhah im super excited to see cushion it looks so cool cause of customization but if its super oily i think it wont work for my tropical country huhuhuhui have actually got a sample of foundation for one of my online orders it s a n21 which is exactly my shade so was super lucky 3 3 which is glow version about medium coverage but since it s glow version it didn t really cover my blemishes or anything oh well after watching review i was expecting it to be super shiny and oily looking on my bination skin but actually it looked really nice and it wasn t sticky at all i was very surprised but it s january now so wear here is very cold and re s a lot of wind so i guess my face didn t produce much oil today when i came home and washed it off after wearing it for 4 5 hours it still didn t look oily however i have applied a bit of primer and powder before as well i m curious how well it would perform in spring or summercould u still do a review on its cushion pleaseeee tt tt wanna see how it works pores etc and wher it s same or not and wher re s any price difference and wher it s wohso do you have any remended foundations for oily skinwhat tone did she uses on videoi m a little scared now i ordered semi matte version and i have bination skin i m really curious about how it wears on my skini ve had product for a long time and stopped using it because it broke me out too and at end of day foundation looked terrible on my facei wonder its not suitable to use in summer it seems really oily and cakeytry 1 4omg so oilyeverybody s skin type is different doesn t mean you need to use 3 blotting papers cos she did or break out cos she did review is extremely mading cos i really love 1 3 one my skin is oily type but overall foundation is good you can t expect your skin to stay oil free throughout day just a foundation right please remend one if re is use innisfree nosebum mineral powder before you put on foundation duhi bought mine two months ago 2 5 n21 it s tooooooo oily on my skin not remended what a waste of moneyyour eye makeup looks so goood 3 nice reviewwhat s ur shadehi howling what s best eye cream you have ever used so faryuzuru hanyui love how much effo she puts on every review i feel like we re friends hahahahaomg i was really looking forward to it i am living in a hot and humid country and will kill me x'\n",

answerzicooohave you tried innisfree microcara waterproof mascara and etude house empties nexthair curl tutorial plsi have nosebum powder because i m really oily and i m almost out so i m wondering if blur one is as matte as regular onei think innnisfree always breaks me outis jeju volcanic suitable for oily skin i m planning to buy cleansing and toneri m a big fan of innisfree products too not a single product i ve tried re has ever irritated my skin which is amazing all ir stuff smells so good too t t i ve noticed a lot of ir packaging says to return jar bottle whatever to innisfree after use have you ever done do you just like take it in and drop it off somewherekorean skincare has crap ton of fragrances in m which is ironic because it causes aging and irritation something koreans are strongly against i tried almost all of what you have and a lot of m have heavy perfumes be careful pplhello have you tried innisfree eco safety perfect waterproof sunblock is it better or one you remended is betterquick question i recently nov 26th bought long wear cushion no 23 true beige on innisfreeworld and it turns out its not my color at all since y don t do refunds or exchanges on ir site i was wondering if you knew a website or place where i can trade makeup or sell gently used make up i only opened it and tried it on my cheek so its not like its old or ruined thank you in advancedwhoa so many products i need to try more innisfree anyway i hope you do aritaum soon please i don t know much about it except for concealer stick i m currently using and i love it so far it reminds me of maybelline brand but out brush xdi m not a beauty expe or something but i saw holika holika pig something something i saw it somewhere it s suppose to remove black heads been wanting to try it but can t cause i m a potato xd nah it s because i dont t have money right now xpi want to try innisfree because of youdo you find blur powder a bit chalky when i tested it at innisfree store it was so of lumpy chunky i ll have to touch it to break it it s not as fine as nosebum one so i was wondering if it d look cakey haha love nosebum one but some times i feel like it makes my face looks white thinking of trying blur powder since you ve talked about it a lot heh love your video 3woah joan you look extra beautiful in video for some reasonyay 3 thanks for making videoi was like i swear i know song looks at description ofc it s my bae zicoinnisfree is pure love i m such an addict to m kind of almost spam all of ir facebook uploads ments until i won ir contest to go to ir 1st anniversary in malaysia pay but yeah loved your empties thanks for reviewing green barley bubble cleansing thinking of switching to since i wanted to try bubble cleansing but y discontinued jeju sparkling one which i wanted to try i personally prefer ir 3 step nose pack but if you are lazy you can try holika holika one it doesn t leave much residue but smell is not great i would love to see eir etude house or skinfood next personally would you remend etude house precious minerals bb cushion i would like to try anor brand s bb cushion however in malaysia innisfree s bb cushion is rm80 for a new one etude house s cost about rm138 so i wanted to know if it is woh it thanks have a great weekjust discovered your channel love your video but it would be great if you could include english subtitles when you re speaking in koreanyou are looking prettier in your video keep up good workimmediate like before i even viewed vid i love innisfree tooi find it really annoying to wash off clay mousse mask tho it s quite stubborn and refuses to wash awaycongratulation u got 11 000 subscribersyour video brighten my day and i love how you speak korean and englishhow s is fun way to treat yourself as a review ridiculousi love powder tooyay 3 i personally like innisfree alot and i am going to buy seed cream and serum after receiving a sample of it i do like green tea mineral mist but i currently have avene mineral water mist so i guess i will buy it after i finished it all up video totally gives a good idea of what i am going to buy next month for my birthday shopping i will want to see a etude house empties i guess well any brand is fine enjoy ur video alot 3i wish we got innisfree here in manila would love to see banila co nexthave you tried biore or kao nose pack it removes

      " 'you need to watch gothamista on youtube she s awesome and is all about skincare and knows a lot about korean skincare and esssenceshi christine cosrx blackhead power liquid actually isn t a toner it is a chemical exfoliator s supposed to be used only a few times a week cozrx does have an aha toner es in a bottle a purple label it has very good review so you should try it out power liquid is supposed to be applied after your toner and essence n left to sink into your skin for 15 20 minutes before applying any or products as for missha essence it also es in a liquid form aerosol version was released to use in summer when it s really hot and you want something to refresh your skin i would suggest getting liquid form as honestly s one of best essences on korean market ors to look at are cosrx snail mucin power essence and innisfree soybean energy essencei m only 17 and i already have so many fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes why please helppppp love your vids btw missha essence also es in a regular non aerosol bottle too you can find it at sokoglam but i also like cosrx advanced snail 96 mucin power essence it s a good price 16 pared to missha tooalso most eye cream can be used as a lip but only strictly hydrating balm type don t use any so of treatment eye cream acids retinals etc on lip you can pat into lines around lip but not on mcosrx bha power liquid is a chemical exfoliant please don t use it as toner and don t use it every single day you can buy aha bha toner instead as it is in toner form you can find more info if you watch wishtrendtv in youtube y are one who adveise cosrx productschristine blackhead power liquid is a chemical exfoliator you re only supposed to use it 1 or 2 times a weekhi some things i learned after discovering korean skincare 2 years ago i have oily acne prone skin caucasian 26 years old hope you are not using volcano mask everyday and bubble mas too y are weekly treatments alternating each time because you can be damaging your skin like i learned hard way to not do more than one treatment per week and se two masks break me out sheet masks are supposed to be last step on days you use m and follow up moisturizer if you feel dry not before toner or anything else is last step i also notice sheet masks do a huge difference on me when i dont use a toner just foam cleansing dry and apply mask for 30mins pat excess and use remaining liquid at night my moisturizer i do se on weekends i remend missha first treatment essence pad in skin before toner one got rid of tiny bumps i had around my cheeks and forehead its meant to make anything else on your skin care be boost up because of fermented ingredients missha time revolution ampoule breaks me out my toner of choice and has kept me blackheads and breakouts free is etude house pore freshener toner holy grail for skin treatments like even out skin tone or dark spots mizon snail works great but you can boost up a vitamic c serum like original pure vitamin c20 serum mixed your moisturizer make sure to use spf if you use during day vitamin c can damage skin if exposed to sun if you want to even out skin and get rid of red spots uneven skin tone i remend mizon all in one snail repair cream one has stopped me breaking out on sides of my face and forehead and is great for oily skin is best product for my skin right now re is also a anti aging version of one great for all skins for eye cream you should go up a level depending on your age go for a thicker eye cream like mizon snail eye cream or sk ii ones more moisture better for wrinkles gel moisturizers are usually lighter but make sure not to layer it moisturizer or you will get whiteheads or tiny bumps for putting to much stuff around eyes and more impoant of all alcohol drinks make you age sooner and breaks you out more than normal and i remend exfoliating one week before your period to avoid huge hormonal breakouts changed my skin insta account and beauty related reviewoh no cosrx bha is not a toner it s an actives you should wait 30 minutes before you should continue next step search about it online or on youtube on how to properly use it and you definitely shouldn t use it everyday or else you ll over exfoliate your poor skinhi i loved video and you have some really great picks here i just thought i d let you know though cosrx blackhead power liquid isn t a toner it s a chemical exfoliant while placement of it in your routine is fine i wouldn t use it on daily as it might dry out or overwhelm your skin because of betaine salicylate which is similar to salicylic acid but to its credit not as harsh it s called blackhead power liquid because bha because betahydroxy acids function to keep your pimples at bay so product in paicular doesn t offer kind of benefits traditional toners would if you want to check anor one out white tone up skin by innisfree and many or toners in innisfree range are great much love for you girl xian beer me 100 above and beyond you are too too amazing christine i really enjoy cut scenes into demonstrating productsi ve learned so much reading asian beauty subreddit it s an amazing resource if you just go to reddit and search asian beauty it should be first thing to show uphey your essence is available in regular toner bottle out sprayer give a few months to show it s skills it is one of best next to skii also cosrx face wash has some stellar ingredients one being some fermented ingredients brighten love it cosrx bha power liquid is not a toner i believe it s a chemical exfolianthey love your skincare video bingewatching m to try to find more products to add to my routine mainly just wanted to let you know cosrx bha blackhead power liquid isn t a toner it s a chemical exfoliant it s fine to use it every day as long as your skin can handle it but just wanted to let you know since it means re s two kinds of exfoliants in your routine and could really irritate your skin ps thank you for listing all

acne scars and hyper pigmentation ingredients are all really natural too jolse also has a really expansive selection of korean cosmetics w free shipping and great pricesnot sure if you came across reddit during your research but people over at asian beauty and skincareaddiction subreddits are pretty knowledgable i ve gotten a lot of tips on how to treat sebaceous filaments blackheads mi love

bottle as well you purchased mist one youtuber i know meejmuse sometimes uses hera cell essence and su m37 secret program essence one you should try getting those itemshi beautiful you put eye patch

and is full of niacin amidecosrx bha liquid isn t a toner s acid chemical exfoliator and only use 2 to 3 times a week check out cosrx aha bha clarifying treatment for a tonerdo i do cleansing at night

videomy favorite essence is iope bio essence intensive conditioning so good i swear by it and no aerosolvariety is good yeah dchristine try manyo factory galactomyces niacin special treatment essence it s affordable and you can really see results in about 2 weeks my skin feels smoor and brighter after using it you can find it on memeboxumm i think u have to wait 20 mins after bha product to put any or skincare after it res just much rules on using it anyways its def not toner its a concentrated acidi have been into korean 10 step skincare for over 2 months now i pretty much don t even own any drugstore or high end skincare i literally tossed many of m big majority of m after i ve used korean producst suck don t work what so ever stupidly overpriced i love amazon for carrying korean products and love a few korean websites where i get my itiemsi reend cosrx snail essencei use cosrx advanced snail 96 mucin power essenceyou can get same missha essence in a regular bottle form it s really good like mistyou should try innisfree s soybean energy essence it focuses on firming and lifting anti aging evening skintone i love it and it doesn t e in an aerosol or spray bottle much luv 333missha makes a cult favorite time revolution essence es in a bottle not a spray canthanks so much i loved your videoyour skin care routine is sooo similar to mine it s awesomegood luck using bha power liquid as toneroh wow so many know it alls dispensing advice just shut up and watch videoso i m confused steps some say after exfoliating you use toner n essence and a serum and n a sheetmask to lock in all good stuff but you use sheetmasks after toner and n use essence and serums so what s right way to do it anyonecan someone enlighten me what is sebum serum toner cleansing and moisturizer i want to have a new apperance im 15you remind me soooo much of jenn im don t know if you know who is but you have same personality xdyou get missha essence out a spray as welli use regular non aerosol version of missha s time revolution essence it has gradually evened out my plexion and skin tone and it s one of my favorite steps in my own 10 step routine i just pour out a bit onto my palm and pat it on price is just right too i got mine sokoglamhello awesome video y make misha first treatment essence in liquid form btw missha does e in a non spray bottle it s not really ann essence it s a first treatment which means you put it on first before anything elsedo you incorporate an alpha hydroxy acid in your routine as well good for chemical exfoliation i see your doing a physical exfoliation which sugar scrubfyi always buy you re korean skincare products ebay korean products are usually waaay overpriced sites like peach lily seoul apocary sephora etc use m to do your research and once you ve made your choices look m up on ebay re are tons of sellers thousands of great review sell products directly korea at ir actual price shipping is almost always free too i always buy m and i ve never had a bad experience petitfee eye patches are 20 at peach lily and 9 on ebaycan t really learn anything new video if you review everything as amazing it s no longer believablecheck out anti aging armour by it cosmetics i think you might like ityikes you said jeju hella wrongyou get missha essence out a spray as wellhi do you use a sunscreen everyday what would you remendso excited i m getting super into korean skincare and your video es out just a few notes missha essence also es in a liquid form and it s been pared to skii essence a lot as far as toners go it s remended you use one for hydrating cause koreans are all about layers of hydration toner essence serum ect cosrx power liquid is more like a treatment which i believe someone mentioned below i m currently testing some products i got sokoglam but now i have to check out seoul apocaryhiii like or people said missha has a non aerosol version of time revolution essence and you should definitely try it i love it also dr thayers rose witch hazel toner is by far my favorite toner i ve tried so far and i ve definitely gone through a lot asian toners and i was pleasantly surprised by dr thayerssince you notice you have fine lines better get etude house moistfull collagen line especially sleeping pack omg so good i can t even explaini heard sk ii essence is really gooddid she put eye patches on backwardsloved so much super helpful just on a shopping binge right now and buying all of i definitely prefer studio lighting e or grey background i think it makes your channel unique and more aestically pleasing keep it up love your channelfor essen i would highly remend innisfree tea tree it works so great i ve been using 2 fullsize bottle and still using it now missha time revolution first treatment essence does e in a liquid form you can actually find it at target but it s cheaper i herbi was intimidated 10 step routine when i first heard it but i was breaking out like crazy last 2 months so i was desperate in trying anything to clear out my skin and i finally gave myself to i i m so glad i did because it clear out my skin you can also checkout soko glam s website because y curate beauty products routine for different skin conditions also i remend missha time revolution first treatment essence it s a dupe for expensive sk ii essencehi christine i wanted to ask you if those products you mentioned are appropiate for oily bination skin i am spain so do you think i will be able to purchase se products and will be as affordable or it would be more expensive if so would still be woh it thanks so muchmisshas time revolution essence is in bottle form i have it you drop liquid on your hand n apply it sane essnce but is better and lasts sooo longyou are not supposed to let clay mask to dry out hun x it will take all moisture out of your skinhi new sub hereampoule is a french word is pronounced like ampooli m not really into skin care because my skin is so sensitive i have reactions to almost everything no matter how gentle y claim to be but i watched video anyway because your voice is so calm and soothingcool video just a little fyi missha has essence in a bottle you can pour it on your hand and pat on it is sold on soko glamhey chrissstttiiine if u just want try k skincare out and not have a full 10 step routine at first what do u think would be most impoant steps great vid

cho soko glam it s really good and you should check out soko glam site too klog has a lot of great aicles d i love peach lily too btw 3hi video came at a good time i was wanting to try a korean skin care steps system and has given me a good jumping off point can i ask do you do daily steps in am and pm just curious xcan you tell me more about seoul apocary i couldn t find much information about founders on ir website would love to hear more of ir story time revolution essence missha actually has a non aerosol version which is in same line as time revolution serum cosrx bha blackhead power liquid is a chemical exfoliant so maybe why your skin feels dry afterwards it is not a toner usually you should only exfolate your skin 2 3 times a week but everyone s skin is different although overexfolating your skin will damage your skin s acid mantle barrier may be damaging to your skin so it might be why you suddenly got fine lines under your eyes skin under eyes is different rest of your face since it is thinnest skin can bee very sensitive once you damage its barrier so to treat it make sure it is hydrated well and use products are for sensitive skin benefits you said about snail is true and snail can also help repairing skin cosrx snail essence has a high concentration of snail which makes it have most snail benefit effects and great for sensitive skin because of its minimum ingredient list so if you feel your skin is getting sensitive because you might have overexfolated n check product out cosrx blackhead liquid is meant to be used on bare face for it to be effective your skin has to be of a low ph and you have to wait 20 30 minutes before applying any or skincare products for paicular exfoliant product cosrx i hope you found information useful anor

skinlove re s a snail essence some people really like idk what pany it is but it s koreanwhat is ampoule serum and essence aren t same thingliar if u researched in 5 days which u said at 0 40 u

eye pointy pa goes to outsidecosrx galactomyces essencei don t know when was posted i m just seeing it any way you asked about putting eye cream on your lip shiseido sells one future solution and its for eyes and lip so yes it s okay to use your eye cream on your lip sandrai have only just got on korean bandwagon i know i know i purchased 4 products and have been using m for just 3 days your video was very helpful and i really appreciate you putting or video you found helpful and good sites to use its a lot to take in are you still loving your korean stuff sorry is 1st video of yours i have watched time to do some binge watching lolshould i wash my face after using sheet masktry washing oil cleansing off warm water i find it better pared to rinsing it off cold water i love some of products u mentioned i d remend little book of skin care by charlotte cho she s founder of soko glam a korean online shop in us its very informative about korean skin care and culturemay i ask if you do know a good product to reduce redness n please remend me one i m using paula s choice and its uhm exfoliating and make my skin look so dry i have uneven redness around my lip and chin thoughi kept wondering why i feel weird connection to video you packed a shitload of info and i love way feels soo natural just ordered two things you use because why eff not i use cos rx essences y re all pretty good but i have oily skin mostly i dont know if helps cosrx bha power liquid is not meant to be used as a toner it s a chemical exfoliant targetting blackheads like most exfoliants some dermatologist would remend not using it everyday cosrx have a bha aha toner only 1 conc so its more suitable for everyday use or try son park beauty wateruse missha time revolution essence in bottle it s not mist just a regular liquid but i put mine in a spray bottle for easier application i tried to switch to mist and had to go back in a week hahaha also not a fan of aerosolsare you korea originssuch a nice down to eah video xx black power liquid is not really a toner its more like a treatment for cleansing out pores i mostly put it where i have blackheads and white heads like my nose chin and my cheek area a little caution some people lots of problem in ir faces should be careful cause it has a so of a purging phase where it just brings all deep seated gunk out of your face have you explored vitamin c essenceswhere are you finding se products at 10 on peach and lily y are definitely 30 abovehello what is essenceps innisfree floral lip are amazing under a lipyou are so cuteshould i wash off residue sheet mask or do we just leave it on and apply serum afteror than fact you are ingesting snail mucus it s probably oki like youi love skincare but honestly my skin became perfect when i stopped washing my face at all i only washed when i showered a few times a week i had very problematic skin growing up but i don t anymore i do wash daily now but only use oil to put on my face after i showerbetween snail cream mizon night mask which one you will suggest for night moisturizeri agree korean skincare does not have to be too expensive and it should always be suited for your skincare above everything else testing pa though may get too taxing trial and error involved may wear some out plus expense and hassle may not be woh it if one s a busy person but would still like to maintain i usually go to nuskin since i know it to be a trusted brand already 30 years in market and site is very informative a tad bit scientific even prices may be more expensive drugstore brands my discount id is ph4106395 you may register as referring id but quality rarely disappoints my asian friends shop at ir korean and japanese websites for a wide collection of face products but basic products like cleansings toners and masks can be purchased in all markets in europe and usnot expensive lha please cek kinimall co id before guysyou look so cute in your little ponytailcosrx has an essence snail mucus it s a little thicker than ors but i really like it it is not in an aerosol bottle but just a plain pump and price was not bad pared to orsnice video i am a korean skincare lover too we have so many products in mon even though our skin types are quite different i love banila co clean it zero skinfood black sugar mask innisfree volcanic mask and petitfee eye patch as well if you are looking for a good moisturizer innisfree s orchid line and green tea seed line are amazingso talkativeyou should really use an emulsion or an ampule or serum before your sheet mask youll feel and see a big difference mask is best used to seal in any treatment you usewhamisa essence tonerwhat s age when you should typically sta using anti aging productshi i have skinfood black sugar mask and innisfree super volcanic clay mask do you remend using both one after or thank you i m beginign in where did you get your white dresschrisssstttiiine you can check out nature republic first essence i have read good review about it i have used etude house pearl aura brightening essence it is not a spray form its good tooi hope made sense you put it on a cotton round or in your palms instead of spray can sokoglam is a korean beauty website y have misha essence and tons of or things regreat videoon my channel overview of korean cosmeticsgreat vid a couple of questions i often see people apply oil before ir moisturizer why is and do you rec it also are you familiar nature republic moist steam cream shea butter i korean 10 step skincare program so where would it fit in in situation i am enjoying your video glad to have found youcheck out podcast snailcast and sta beginning four blogger girls on re have been in k beauty scene for sometime now and are really well informed for hyper pigmentation i have seen good results when adding in a vitamin c serum in morning c20 and n a niacinamide serum at night don t use at same time since y cancel each or out blogger fifty shades of snails fiddy snails has same skin concerns as you and you can look to her for inspirationi m glad i found your channel because i have been using k beauty skin care products for 3 years now and i m still learning i m only using 5 to 6 steps because i find m to be too much for me i just ordered more products so i can try out 10 step routine and to see if re is any difference i have a mild non stop break out on my forehead because i have been trying out new makeup products i love makeup so much but i have to take care my skin first before anything elsewhy don t you like aerosol bottlesfirst off i d like to say awesome video i m sure re s some flexibility in steps as skincare isn t black white but usually what i would do is double cleanse exfoliate or substitute a clay wash off mask doing only a few times a week don t want to over exfoliate or your skin will overpensate for lack of its natural oils toner essence serum ampoule sheet mask eye cream moisturizer or substitute an overnight sleeping mask and lastly sun protection if doing your routine during day anor thing is essence and serum ampoules should be applied in order of consistency staing thinnest consistency working your way to thickest i would remend changing your toner to something or than bha power blackhead liquid as is meant to be use once or twice a week as it is a chemical exfoliant over using it could have some damaging effects on your skin i would remend something like son park beauty water or laneige power essential skin toner avail at target really allow skin time to absorb products sometimes when i do entire 10 steps it ll take me more than an hour i feel like if i rush it n all wonderful products i m using is just going to waste b c i m just wiping it off next product hopefully i was of some help to you or to ors reading ments it s great to see so many people sharing ir skincare routines as it gives myself and ors an oppounity to learn develop evolve our own routinesok girls if your in uk i can highly remend you check out amazon and yes style website for korean skincare is very interesting topic for me as a korean brands on peach lily are more like not popular in korea but getting ir fame outside of korea recently stylekorean has all famous and classic korean beauty brands i personally like almost every product innisfree iope which is owned by korean powerhouse beauty brand amore pacific iope is more targeting around 30 years old innisfree is targeting slightly younger than iope but both are good enough to any age as someone said below you can buy missha essence in regular liquid form ir website we called it as a substitute for skii essence it has been loved by many people you gotta try korean make up as well bb cc air cushion and many ors are all staed koreaha i immediately scrolled down to see if re s responses ab eye cream for lip and n realized is a brand new video how interesting have never heard before do you still make cooking video i use your quick pickle trick all time so good on tacoschristine what s your favorite dry shampoo sorry if you ve already answered i would love to see a hair video xxcosrx s bha liquid is a chemical exfoliant not a toner what happened to your five days of researchomg christine i use about 80 of products you mentioned yay asian beauty productshow old are youanor unhelpful video just a bunch of talking and unnecessary stories staying at boyfriends house and so on wish people can just get to point seems like menters are helping you rar than you helping usplease notice me if you dont use makeup its ok to not use oil based cleansing and do you have sensitive skin how do you find skin food black sugar mask wash off is too rough for sensitive skin thank youit s just my personal opinion a skin don t need so much stuff at same time cleansing scrub toner serum and moisturizer are enough if it s day include sunscreen and if it s night include face mask s all people don t have to do 10 step skin care it s just a waste if money time and energy think people'\n",

handsooooooooooooooooooooomelove youohwow i can t believe is shade 23 im waiting for apieu bb cushion 23 i bought online and im getting quite nervous cause im waaaay darker than u xd hahaacan i use water glow on oily skin@edward avila have you been to paula s choice stores in korea am so jealous y have non in uki m super pale and usually get lightest shade of any foundation concealer etc but i m so not sure about product like you said darkest shade looks pretty friggin light lol do you have any suggestions awesome video by waywow i think your review is always better than or i like so is it a foundation or a bb creami m really worried now i feel like i have some pale ass skin but he said he had darkest shade and it still is so pale but i wanna buy it anyways i don t know which shade to geti usually get natural beige i use tude house cushion but i want to try cushion out should i get natural beige cushion or a darker shade considering you said ampoule cushion is really lighthow much time is last on your skin and is good for dry patches on skinits like korean make up is all about dewy gawddd my bination to oily skin just cant adapt i cant stand dewiness on my skin dhi i was wondering which cushion suitable for me since i had bination skin which you would remend etude house or innifreehi edward can you still remend to me i have kind of oily skin also i have acne marks will wait for you to answer thanksi pretty damn pale to point no foundation here in nz can match my skin so i ordered 3 cushions all in light beige which is lightest but after watching i might have made a mistake if is true beige i might have ordered m all too pale fml i am crossing my fingers but i love review and it is making my hope light beige does match my skin because cushion looks amazingi have dry skin doesn t know meaning of oil lol i ve been using for past few months after my skincare and no matter what i do i can t stand it it feels moisturizing and wears well for about an hour but after it seems to highlight my dry skin and makes me look oily af i ve tried putting a setting powder over it but it doesn t seem to help i don t know why it isn t working for mei don t like ampoule intense cushion it has no coveragewould you remend etude house precious mineral any cushion natural pearl aura or to dry skin i am living in a humid countryit only lasted you a month and a half i used mine every single day and it lasted me 7 monthsso which one better innisfree or etude house i want to buy cushion makeup but dont know which one should i buy both products have good review thoedward which website did you buy itwhich shade is are all innisfree cushion refills interchangeable i have innisfree water glow cushion and i want to try ampoule intense cushion could i just get ampoule intense refill and put it into my water glow casedo you know if innisfree s concealers match up colors of bb cushions ampoule intense cushion in 13 is only makeup i ve ever found is light enough for my skin color only problem is it s hard to reach areas i need to conceal like around my nostrils and eyes cushion and when i try to apply it fingers to those areas it just wipes off i m thinking about getting ir concealer in lightest shade but idk if colors match up i m worried about concealer being too darki think is strange to see a guy put make up on'\n",

am still glad y came up so many shades maybe y will expand it more foundation is actually really good one layer looks like satin semi matte full coverage on me i don t even need concealer on gray dark circles but no exact match sadly i am nc 42 indian skin tone and w31 and n31 are too light and w33 is too e for me given ir extensive shade range in korea those 9 shades different finishes and undeones i am looking forward to what else innisfree does i really wish y put in international stores thoi have opposite problem where i m so pale i can t find a foundation matches me unless i spend like 50 but i like korean makeup especially etude house cause it matches my paleness out making me yellow or e but s just my personal problem it seems everything is marketed towards middle area where everything is like almond color in america sigh but i do love you re video and makeup tutorials i m excited more brands are expending ir shade rangecan innisfree hurry up and sponsor hire you for promotions lolam i specifically gonna make a stop at innisfree store next time i go visit peeps in ny um yes specifically cause of video finish is gorgeous and i ve been waiting for someone to try out

      " 'hai steph maafin ment ku panjang nih kyk ceramah tapi mau saran nih berdasarkan pengetahuanku tentang skincare dan pengalaman juga hehe kan tadi kamu bilang kalo ga pake clean n clear facial wash kerasa kurang bersih tapi kerasa kering banget coba deh pake first cleansing berbahan oil atau balm contohnya biore cleansing oil atau banila co cleansing balm krna biasanya kalo cleansing oil atau balm hasilnya lebih ngangkat makeup drpd micellar water terus abis itu pake facial foam yg ga pake sls sles als ales maap banyak hehe kepanjangannya apa kamu google aja yah jadi kulitnya ga makin kering kasian soalnya kulitnya kalo udah kering dipakein 4 bahan itu terus jadi makin kering terus menurut kamu kyknya terlalu banyak scrubbing deh facial wash nya aja udh ada scrub nya sementara kamu msh scrub pake st ives 1 2 kali seminggu lagi mungkin ngga kulit kamu jadi kering dan suka ngelupas karena tanpa sadar kamu overexfoliate oh iya juga pernah pake cosrx bha summer pore itu dan kandungan alkoholnya tinggi banget kan ada di ingredients list kedua kalo ngga salah kebayang dong setinggi apa kandungan alkoholnya alkohol itu salah satu bahan yg memicu kulit jadi kering lho jadi saran sih jangan pake toner yg itu dia juga mengandung bha yang cenderung lebih cocok untuk kulit berminyak sementara kalo untuk kulit kering lebih cocok pake aha karena cenderung bisa meningkatkan kelembaban alami kulit sekali lagi maaf ya panjang banget maaf juga kalo ada yg salah semoga bisa membantustep skincare nya amburadul dahmask routine kaakkkk must make nowsepintas kaya acha

      " 'when she held up mirror i thought i would see myself for a stupid secondkennie for cushion you need to reduce your skincare greasyness coz its already contain those and please dabbing not swap and for new puff maybe you need anor puff for different consistency creamier for firmer puff for any new puff better to wash it first use baby soap bar just to make it more bouncyomg i might actually be able to buy foundation a korean brand mind blowngirl you re glowing so bright i hadda turn my phone brightness downwatching patch coverage struggle at least color matched at least color erghi think because korean cushions have skincare in m already sometimes skincare in cushion clashes skincare you put on before s why your or mat foundations had no issues your skin care because those foundations have no skin care in m to clash each oryesss innisfree doing ir thing i m more on tan side and yes finally a korean product suits meokay innisfree i see youi think koreans like more of dewy light foundation out too much coverage in generalgiirrrrll do you even have pores goddamn you are glowingyoure supposed to dab puff not swipe it all over your face was why your skin and bb cream coulnt sit well togeri have purchased 2 formulations in chocolate a little deep for my winter skin but i like it aqua formation felt better for me i ve never had much luck matte but jump golden tan to chocolate isss so different my safety rule is go for darkest shade it s always worked for drug store and you are right my tone shouldn t be darkest shade eiri was it thinking on way home kennie should make a video reviewing seok let s go koreaboi if you don t want aqua foundation send it my way9 59 kennie in your areaaaaaaaaawhen she staed swiping her face and making it worse second try looked super pretty it s first foundation of actually give a try it s not expensive so it s not bad thanks kendall for doing videoi like dewy one better but i do like how matte one is not like matte matte lol i just wanna praise eyebrow gods every time i see you snatched peacei know what you mean but trick to it is you need to gently pat it on your face i have been using korean japanese makeup and skin care for a long time even before n cushion covers came into existence so when inexperienced my first cc i had same feelin later i learned how to apply it and n even heavy skincare it will work keep patting it but if you want extra coverage etude house has good one too and bcdation by tony molykorea all about ir diversity now i wonder why y made not it s not a good thing but i m kinda confused as to whywat no wayi m so glad you reviewed se i ve been wanting to try innisfree cushions since new shades came out you re first person i ve seen even talk about m review was really detailed and i needed it thank youokay so my birthday was yesterday and i turned 14 i got 100 in birthday money and you already know i don t use makeup yet but shiz is about to get blown off real quickwhen i saw

innisfree cushion pact and is amazing so proud of you i got matched for golden caramel and ir color range for ir sta off launch is amazing i did have some of same problems but realized after it works best as simple as possible for ir soft matte pact as well as powder after i recently went to store and found out shades in ir newest matte liquid foundation shades may be a bit different pact cushion due to difference in what y do individually on go vs full on face i got matched for golden walnut for ir matte liquid foundation if you can get ir serum and matte powder matte powder has mint in it which helps matte cushion cool off and set inshe literally doesn t have pores your skin is glowing gurrlllyou re so beautiful and i like your humour cool video kendal thanksmaybe try it different skincare underneath i always have to find right bo to work my skincarewhat are your favorite cushion foundations also what s your skin typegirl what lip product you wearingkennie i was thinking if you still want a dewy looking finish build up matte foundation and do one last layer of dewy foundation it s transparency will show coverage but keep it a little dewy probably a good way to use it i hope worksit s so weird you can do a korean foundation review what a world we live inbishhhhhh i am shook omg i am overjoyed right noware u made real beauty for girls her skarokay but real question is can i buy it in storesdab dab dab make your face look fabhonestly how do you not have an affiliate or promo code m yet17 24 i ve got hella notifications ohs to nos was probably me memeswondering if

about son and park s beauty water would you mind doing a review of product please thanks in advancefinally innisfree has e thruuuuyour skin is so beautiful and dewy naturally way y swatched shades on ir channel is so weird though i was looking through to see if i could find a match but y had two really pale girls swatching and one dark skin girl which doesn t help me a light skin at all lol anyone know anyone who has swatched some of in between shades packaging makes me want to buy it even more dammityou didn t seem convinced but se look amazing on you i m gonna buy both because of video hai cant stop looking at those amazing browsure so beautifuljust wanted to say you are sooooo prettysoooo 5 mins after i watched video i ordered it1 your skin is already beautiful out make up holy 2 if you are using contacts y look really good on you if not your eyes are beautiful 3 nice videoit s funny because as a person who does not know how to put on concealer and foundation i cannot really understand what it is you are necessarily not agreeing for makeup because to me it looks same and your skin is so soft and pretty but again what would i knowdid you prep your skin a foundation primer before adding cushion foundationwe don t have se colors in koreawhat lip colour are you wearing at endfinally i found i think korean just have foundation for light skindang if all of those browns are warm ik y don t have my coloryour eyes are beautifulslaying us as alwaysyour skin is so beautifulthank you video is very helpfuli m ordering rn but everytime at checkout it changes w37 to c13 idk if

kenniei m all for aqua fit i mend you because i wouldn t know what too dou r so prettywhat s your fave matte or semi matte natural and dewier cushion foundationsy expanded shade rangei m confused i

color and it does not look patch oily i loved ityou should try rolling tapping insteadcan you detail more about cushion name and type stripped cushion and how could i purchase it pleasei must be living under a rock i do not follow k beauty and i did not know y had foundations for darker skin tones idea of a cushion foundation being cool but not rlly having oppounity to buy bc you re brown relatable afwhy am i just finding your channelokay i life under a rocksmack smack smack cushion on your faceyou are sooo pretty ahim excited to try cant believe it i never thought i d live long enough

is to use and i love how looks on you xxxleft side looks darkerkennie gangi swear i was waiting for itwhat is background music i hear it in most video i watchyour skin is just perfecthmm i i would have to get chocolate and in dewy i m very surprised but and i hope more kbrands take noticey are not available in ir international eshop wooouuuuuhi heard about lovely edward avila lowkey lip king and i have high hopes had to do before watching i just know your excited i was tooso sad se colours shades arent available in australiais innis only pany you know does darker shades also do you ever straighten your natural hair would you ever do a video on itfrik yeshooooooh is your real eye colour even if y are lenses you are so pretty whaat oomg so happy about review hard to find innisfree foundation reviewwhat lip product are you using soo prettyi know question doesn t fit to video but how can i get rid of blackheads i tried everything but nothing works my nose looks like a freaking strawberry help mehhhi love your contacts what color is it and where did you get it pleasehave you tried jungsaemmol foundation i know its hella expensive but she got a real dark shades rangethanks soooooo much for doing a thorough and enteaining review on products both finishes looked fantastic on you although i prefer matte finish i ve now subscribed to you and can t wait to watch more and learn more youyour skin is too good for me to tell differenceyah i ll pass everybody trying to be fenty beauty please stop lol rihanna already made make for everybody loli just want to know what shi you re wearing it s so nicewell i see some ments saying she should have dab cushion instead of swap it but if your face has lots of baby hair n swap it babe cuz it fits much better what korean care is layering veryyyy thin foundation on skin to avoid cakey build on thier skin so swap it if you wantgood shot i so so sooooooo appreciate video i willbe giving a tryhi kennie do you know of any tips korean makeup for people dry skini couldn t tell how bad it looked first time it looks good color looks good toolove your video you re so cuteapparently matte ness also depends on which puff you buy blue one is more dewy glow brown one is more mattei thought her neck was wrinkly in thumbnail lolcould you do a video on all moisturizing products you own and maybe talk about which ones you do and don t remend and why wear is getting a bit colder and ya girl getting dry over hereyou are hitting your face real hardtutorial on eye looki got powder pact innisfree to use for oil control and it works pretty nicely i might go for liquid cushion too in ir road store in new york y offer color match toowhat color are your contactsit looks freaking amazing on camera but i saw some bad cushions before so i think i know what you mean about caking upit actually made your skin look very beautifulwhat lip color are you wearing at 16 53i know a foundation does i don t know why really no or foundation does s why you shouldn t wear a ton of skincare under your makeupquestion i live in south korea and i m wondering if se would be in innisfree stores for pocwhy did i only find video nowomggg yesssis it veganyour eyes are beautiful xoi m so confuse watching video bcz i thought ur skin is visually very beautiful and whan u tap tap cushion it seems looked so fine and blurry until i recognized cushion isn t blended well look is everythinganyone know if se are available in europe preferably ship able to germany because until now i ve only read it being available in usim confused coz it says its fragrance free and its notcould you review ysl cushion foundation plzwhy are you so prettyoooo i had a foundation like one iman s cream foundation did to me back in day which was awful because powder one was so excellentyou re so prettybeautifull lipwell in all fairness your not dark at all your light tannedi don t know how long y have been working on so its probably not but maybe if it came out later i would say is influenced by rihanna s fenty launch since it was so successfuldid you use a lip or is your natural lip colorwhich brand of dewy foundation would you say is best on market right now also thanks for demoi feel like all foundations do to my skin so i decided to not wear foundation anymorecan you buy it in america and ship it to chinaidk if i m tripping or something but your eyebrows lookin extra fleek in video wtffffffffff i m shookedtpat pat pati thought was gonna be two shades of tan but ok innisfree e through if price is right we will seei wanna try i m an nc42 in mac and golden nude in bare minerals original foundationi m fair to medium skintone and i found long wear cushion foundation to give slightly white cast on me which i m guessing must be cause of high spf i really liked how long wear looked on youi love youwhat lip are you wearing is actually pretty cool i now have a chance of getting a cushion it might be a lil off but it s nice to see y have a wider color rangewhat are you wearing on your lip do tell thanksilove ur contacts what brand are y or where did u get m what do u do to get ur teeth so bright can u also do a skin care routine ur skin is glowing love how pretty u look out makeupdoes anyone know if darker colors are available in korea eir in store or onlinekorean makeup here i e honestly western make up to me is extra to me so i always prefered korean makeupdont swipe so much just patpatpatpat swiping cushions can cause patchiness and suchhi do you know if 14 shades are available in korea or just on websiteit looks guud thopayingi also wear nc45 in mac but it took runs a bit e on me but i wear 360 in fenty if we were going off of fenty shades you re 3 shades lighter than me is how i should shop for cushionsjust went to ir website no luck on finding se products is it only shipping america i live in israel so i m on world innisfree siteit s definitely very cakey and clumpyfenty beauty boom mind blownvery interesting i may have to check it out i love shade matchomg what lip product are you using in video colour is besitofulbrrruhhh lolr u blackbe careful read ingredient on packaging or go to re website and read it it says some of main ingredients can cause cancer or hormonal changes which is not goodare darker skin tones only for foreign market because it seems like korean market is still only selling 4 light colors puffs suck try using a brush but noneless its cuteomg aqua one is sooooo pwetty too bad innisfree in my area only brought 13 23 dang i wish y brought deep shades heree i m also digging it bcs i love dewy foundie since i cant stand my skin looks like deseyou dragged sponge which creates blotchiness if you only bounce puff on skin re won t be any blotchinessit s too much trouble to go through to get some makeup on imagine if fenty did no one will give it second chancei need i don t wear much makeup anymore so i may not use it but damn do i need iti would check if foundation is silicone based or water based and see if is conflicting your or skincarei use to always think if you had dry skin n meant you had to choose dewy makeup but i always felt y made me look too shiny i prefer more of a satiny finish so i might just go pick matte one up hope it goes well my face oil and not leave any weird patches like hyaluronic acidyour brows are niceokay but what if i don t know wich one maches my skin tone sorry if i sound stupidthank goodness re are panies out re realizing y are missing a whole demographic like y are missing so much money by not being able to market to different tones i always wanted to try korean make up because y seem so much better i hope y have my shade or at least in futurei love y expanded ir shades but y re not cruelty freeare u half asianwill i be able to buy se shades at any innisfree branch in koreaanyone knows if y carry se cushions in korea or if us website delivers to korea cause i usually only see light shades in stores here'\n",

      " 'well it s only an extract so real green tea percentage in product is unknown i mean y could just use 1 green tea and dilute it in 99 water and called it green tea extract n use 70s of it into serumguys i am getting green tea serum next month i have only bination acne skin so i ll update and let you guy know a month later actually not really great i love packaging and small container but every time i put on my skin it really burns my faceu also my acne get worse my warnings are don t get it if your skin cannot tolerate alcohol or fragrance maybe not suitable for seriously oily or acneic skin as i ve heard recently green tea actually stimulate your sebaceous gland to produce more oil so maybe i remend it for dry skin people if y have strong skin barrier i m not saying product is rubbish or trash or whatever but i think it really depends on what kind of skin you have so please patch test before you put it on ur face how to patch test for acne reaction use it on where you get most frequent breakouts for allergic reaction behind your ears or backs as far as i know product cannot make you purge as it does not have any chemical exfoliants or enzymes or niacinamide refore if you break out stop using it never use it if it breaks you out cause i did same thing even if i broke out and it almost damaged my skin now i m using ordinary serum is alcohol fragrance free 2 months later ha im gonna give it to my friend who can tolerate serum only good thing about is it feels light weight and smells like perfume bad bad bad good bye serum t t three months later my skin is more sensitive than before and spider hell nah my skin was red like i was burnt im taking acne antibiotic now and actually it s helping me my skin is acne free almost lots of dark spots left by acne but my skin is thinner now sensitive i can feel it so my last advice is only for unsensitive and alcohol fragrance tolerant skin new update i staed out a new skincare routine my skin is kinda clear now thankfully i hope you guys skin gets clear tooi bought innisfree because of yoonaany idea about frenchise cost about innisfree video couldn t e at a better time i m traveling abroad now and just

handsome treatment works really well i m really happy to see good improvements which one would you remend more cushion or liquid foundation insteadwhat contacts are you wearingdoes it glow finish or

going to love seriously thank you for video because i search a fondation and i don t really know about it i think i m going to buy fondation bye bye andi love how your filming and your friend is in background taking pictures he s so adorablewho is model brandi thought title said insfire instead of innisfree damnit sugacan it cover my deep dark secretsomg i m about to order right now i know it s summer but my skin is as dry as a deseplease do a favorite dewy finish foundation cushion bbhe s good on bed niceu please makeup himlooks very good on youlooks very good on youhi ed awesome vid would you suggest foundation for people oily skin do you have oily skinlove your video i made one a lighter coverage for guys using bourjois could imagine you d suit dewy ones toois it kind of like l oreal true match where its thin and medium coverage but also texture is thin and powder ish i was thinking of trying innisfree ampoule intense foundation but i hate testing it out at store bc store is kind of intimidating and also its like 5x more expensive in australia so i was thinking of buying it when i go to korea in march alsooo yaaass bitch i see glodo u still liking it going to gv a try soonwatching your makeup test video really relax me super hahahahawhat brush is he using i see its real techniques but what brush exactly is it blush brush expe face brushi love ur hair and uwho else had a hard time paying attention to edward cas of his cute friend in backi just noticed jongwons sweat patch under his armif edward has cute handsome awesome boyfriend i am going to sta crying so hard i m so envywhat happened your hand whatever love it your foundation review ssam living in a humid tropical country normal bination clear skin i love dewy finishes but dont want a heavy formula dont want a powdery finish like long wear cushion any suggestionsi like dowy look too so i use foundation and n i build it up cuhion so i have extra coveragewhich shade is inis he your boyfriend hahaha just askinwow it doesn t even look like you re wearing anythinghis friend is so cutei love innisfree everythingwhat contact lenses do you havewhat was jongwon watchingwahh your skin looks really good foundation c it s like re s a filter on your face omg xdvery nice review d innisfree is da bombwhat was treatment you did i have same acne intentions but i don t have any red acne anymorei bought some stuff in ir online store today cause you say it s good judging by your face it has to be truth sounds pretty cheesy but i actually mean how products look on your face well anyway i m super excited and broke yaywhat brush are you using in vidgirl your nose looks snatched in videoomgcan you do a video on how you maintain your hair colorlove your video what is your ultimate favorite cushionko h u lun n aaaaaaai m usually not one for foundation or dewy look but i think i may have to try new foundation if it really is as light as you say it could be great for me question where did you get brush because it looks amazing also your hoodie looks like fuzziest warmest thing everif only kind of foundation which has very white color is not awkward on my faceuse those triangle or rectangular disposable sponges well i reuse m for a few times before i throw away because for tear shaped sponge if it is not beauty blender it wont expand when u put water thus it is still quite hard so it will absorb all foundation and give very little coverage key is to get a soft sponge soft sponge gives a lot coveragethanx for review finally a good light coverage foundation has a natural finish but really am sorry i was really into it till you friend got into frame and staed talking on phone i just lost all of my concentration and staed laughing at how cute he was xdcan i ask what circle lens are you wearinghelp i need your remendations of makeup brushes korean brandsholafirst i was distracted by what happened to your hand like seriously what happened you boxing recently and n by your friend xd still enjoyed it though dedward love ya like a crazy person thanks for making se awesome video oh yeah and innisfree is pronounced inishfree its an irish name for a place anyway thanks so much for se awesome videoyoure getting a little tan edward phaha your funnyheyyy i m looking to buy a liquid foundation i m not sure which foundation i should get etude house double lasting or innisfree one which one looks more natural and i have dry to bination skin thank you so muchwhatever i wear or try on my face it s always greasy look my mom doesn t like it and some of my friends dislike it also even my younger sibling tells me my face is melting lol i hated it at one point but after you said you like greasy look i noticed my face was shiny and looked dewey so i have a bit more confidence now thank youeddie i wonder which brand circle lenses are you using looks quite natural btw foundation seriously looks soo airbrushed on your skin and also wanted to let you know even someone turkey so far away reaaaally enjoys your video feels like i m watching a friend or something lol cuz you are like such a warm personare se yellow based or pink based i have yellow undeoneswhere did you buy itfirstwould you say foundation has a lot more coverage than cushion i used cushion for some time and i really loved healthy glow it gave my skin but a lot of my redness and dark spots peaked through btw your skin looks greathey eddie i just wanna ask u something have u ever tried nature republic super origin bb cream how does innisfree foundation pares to nr bb cream i dont really know about bb cream and foundation stuff but i got nr bb cream sample as a free gift and i ve been loving it but its kinda hard to find product here in my country so i m thinking of trying innisfree foundation instead or maybe u can suggest me some product are kinda similar i dont really need a good coverage bcoz i dont really have much acne scar on my face just some redness around my nose i just want something can even out my skin tone and kinda give a matte finish i really hope u can help me btw i really love ur channel eddie fightingi use innisfree foundation as well but one downside is y have v little shades but im lucky y hv mine lmaowhat kind of brush do you useis it pinkish toned is it suitable for yellow toned skinwhy you so like make up but you are a boy i thing soi feel like se korean products esp foundations only last a few hours on my face how do i make m last also products separatei don t even know why i watch your video s really but i love m because y upper my mude i think if you do more fun stuff and get funny friends around and sta blogging you subscriber base will go up so fast awcorse many things most be done but i say as a financial expe i sea where you can make a lot of money and you my friend are golden whole xdwhat song titlei haven t looked too much at new innisfree shades but y usually have 13 21 and 23 i know y have added 21p which is a pink beige i can t imagine anything lighter than 13 it s super pale and i m half white'\n",
      " 'awesome idea of using paper on a wet surface to test productlove how video is straight to pointi ve only poked three holes in clear covering allows enough powder to get through a little tap or two amount came out on video was crazy a little really does go a long way powder it s matifying powers are amazing but you will look flat and ghostly if you use too much i wish it came in a larger size thoughdoes it apply before makeup how is it used i want to buy one but i have no ideai really love product it really helps control oil on my skin but sad is powder is too small haha i feel not satisfy about it xd hope innisfree would make mineral sebum little big than actual size overall i give 9 8 10'\n",

in india try making routine affordable product you youtubers are sponsered se product you guys do not put your money in i have been watching your all video you are good in doing makeup and reviewing products but i think you should do honest review mostly all your skincare video are just like an adveisement but try adveising some affordable product and finally please don t mad people by claming only expensive product can give you a perfect skin i do have oily acne prone skin if i get acne i just use home remedy turmeric work best i don t spend my parents hard earned money on such kind of product products might work well but not all can afford each product for 1000 and above i am not trying to be mean but is fact behind all of us and yourself i personally feel all kinds of video mad

could you maybe do a 7days video of what youre putting on youre pretty faces every day im kind of confused as for what i should put on my face every day thanks girls i love you so muchi really like how re were multiple dupes at different price points s really impoantmy favorite dupe for tatcha water cream is belif aqua bomb very similar and about half pricemaybe clinique moisture surge will be a nice option for water cream at least i think it is fantastic for my mature skinlove little elephant during drunk elephant product review was really cuteomg i love your channel ever since i got my bday gift drunk elephant sophora i ve been obsessed but its so expensive thanks for showing dupes to se amazingly expensive productswow stumbled across channel and i am stunned beautifully explained to t on all products and ir ingredients1 mistake in video was stating lactic acid is a bha lactic acid is ahai heard new neutrogena line was bomb diggitydupe for tatcha essence cosrx galactomyces 95 tonerfor rose toner guys re are 2 or dupes i remend iunik rose galatomyces essential toner an absolute fav of mine because it has kind of missha time revolution benefits plus its very good fod dehydrated skin a well as nacific real floral toner rose real fermented rose petals also so good both korean brands available on yestyle for around 15 you re wele aztec clay will kick your skins ass i have super oily skin and i usually only use it as a spot treatmentif you want a clay mask does tututututu go for nature bamboo charcoal mudpacklove your channel for drunk elephant hyaluronic acid instructions on one of kit i got said to mix marula oil i do i have oily dehrated skini love your video i am always looking forward to m about b hydra serum i loved using it while i did but it is made to be a small step in larger drunk elephant regimen a lot of ir products can be used on ir own but b hydra i think is really designed to be used in conjunction ir or products i m pretty sure instructions for both c firma and glycolic night serum say to use b hydra right after followed up by a moisturizer and or marula oil y even suggest cocktailing everything toger if you want which i never did because e on whole fun is in doing things slowly step by step so yeah i never found it hydrating but it was so soothing and felt cooling on my skin after more active vitamin c or aha bha serums n i always followed up at least marula oil b hydra just kind of paved way for real moisturizing stuff having said all made for a super expensive skincare routine so i am still on hunt for a more moderately priced skincare routine will give me same results soooo i am super looking forward to vitamin c and glycolic acid video you promised herei love video please do more dupe videoi m surprised no one has mentioned himalayan charcoal purifying glow mask body shop it is literally best dupe and affordable mud mask i ve tried so fari have bo skin and de b hydra didn t do anything for

acid i heard on anor skincare channel i m sorry i wish i could remember which hydrating acid is supposed to work like it gars nearby moisture and stores in in skin means into your skin if you re like me dry skin in a dese area only place it can draw moisture is your skin so s why it can feel plump at first and n even more dry because it is is my frustration hyaluronic acid because i definitely

just personal opinionyou should ve tried belif true cream aqua bomb it s magical it falls in same category s tatcha water creamso glad i stumbled upon channel subbedas far as drunk elephant b hydra i agree it isn t hydrating i prefer first aid beauty hydrating serum because it lasts longergood dupe for glamglow supermud is also body shop himalayan charcoal maskugh yes drunk elephant hydrating serum is a scam i spent all money basically for bulky packaging i used entire thing and didn t feel like it did anything for my dry skin personally i think ordinary s hyaluronic acid serum is 10x better than de onecan t wait for or video you ve mentioneddddb hydra draws water and moisture out of my skin and surrounding skincare products always leaving my skin dry so i have to eir add it into an emulsion or hydrate serum avene rmal wateri have fresh toner at 1st i didn t like it at all because i felt like it would leave a sticky feeling on me i don t like my face feeling sticky now i use it anor toner glamglow and now i love it so much also i love neutragena hydrating moisturizeri use drunk elephant b hydra i honestly don t notice a difference i use it after my toner i have normal to

made it difficult to understand you i had to turn video off halfwayi ve tried hyaluronic acid serum ordinary and it s really good i also tried neutrogena water gel moisturizer and clinique moisture surge and dramatically different moisturizing gel clinique as well and all 3 of m cause me redness and irritation so at beginning i thought it was hyaluronic acid so i stop using m but i saw same results clinique so i stop those as well and check out ingredients and re was silicone on everything but serum so i look for a moisturizer out it and my skin staed to heal and get more clear so when i felt good again i incorporated serum and everything was good so i notice it was silicone so just beware of ingredients not everything affordable is bad and not everything high end it s good just pay

it helps me out to decide which product is best for me thanks jenyou were actually first youtuber to get me onto innisfree back in your try it tuesday video i use green tea skin care line and i love fragrance i do think products are a little too watery for my liking but it can sometimes be refreshing but my ultimate favoriteeeeeeee product innisfree so far is ir volcanic ash clay mask i love it so much it smells so fresh and i see instant results my face always feels super smooth and clean after mask i love everything about it love youhi jen love your video so awesome to know you re australia too it sounds great to hear someone australia and also you do great tutorials using some of korean street brands are inexpensive to buy i just staed getting into make up and i paicularly prefer korean make up brands because kpop s a bad reason but korean anything just appeals to me most at moment i paicularly like innisfree as a brand in general because everything looks so natural yet classy at same time and i had my first korean cosmetic brand experience innisfree as well innisfree anti bija spot essence w which is sadly not available anymore online on innisfreeworld website it s funny how you re paicular about fragrances but i found y all smell nice so i had no problem it i guess you could say i am now a die hard loyal fan of innisfree and i will love anything it has off topic but dying to ask because i don t know where to as someone who s still so inexperienced when would you use bb cream or liquid foundation i understand differences but seeing as liquid foundation is tons better i see no point in buying bb cream but i saw your make up collection which is astounding btw and it has tubes of bb cream in it so i was wondering what so of occasion would you use bb cream and whyplease do a review for cosrx i think i remember seeing you talk about it alitle bit on snapchat but i cant rememberjen i ve actually watched a majority of your try it tuesday video and used m as a reference when i went to korea a few years ago nosebum powder was bought based on your remendation i bought 2 and it really does last a long time i m currently finishing up my 1st one and it was probably one of best purchases i made lol i wanna try out primer now too i already know i m going to love new serieshey jen really love new series can u pls do a review laneige and pony

yesterday was first time i put my innisfree long wear cushion on and boy it really emphasized dry spots on my skin thank you for videohave you tried water fit cushion innisfree how does it pare to long wear one thanksi have same problem laneige bb cushion pore control version it makes my face look kinda cakey cos it clings onto my dry patches c but i have bo skin do i need to put on a much heavier moisturizer someone help pls especially if you have same problem like me laneige bb cushion pore controlgot shade 21 it was super light on my facethanks so much for review i was trying to decide which cushion to buy since my skin is really oily and summer wear in pueo rico really doesn t help at all gonna give a trywhat colour did you getdo you think you might be able to review some korean day moisturizers and night cream i have really dry skin like you but i have run into so many moisturizers just sit on my skin or are really sticky tacky which is not good at all for dry skin re are so many great options out re like saem innisfree and skinfood so i d be really interested in hearing what you have to say about m your video have truly been so helpful to me thank you for putting a lot of time and work into mhello i was wondering if you need to prime your face when you use product since my face is quite oily and often sweatyhi morgan i m slightly new to korean beauty and im struggling to find a cushion foundation for my skin type i have dry skin like you and i d prefer something has a medium coverage you can build if anyone could give me some help would be greatwhat s your lip color y look so nice on you 3i think it s meant for oily skinned beauties m i think i remember seeing it listed on innisfree website moisture version is one for dry skini heard laneige cushion is a very popular and is already sold in target already you can check out tooi really liked new type of review re are so many ways to wear a bb cream or foundation so it s really good you showed us different methods and results it gives a better understanding of product and a more honest review i ve never tried a cushion foundation before but seeing results i will definitely sta using onehi i really hope you reply to i recently bought bb cushion and i had really dry skin and clogged pores looks like bumps on my forehead it emphasizes my dry skin like crazy but it s only foundation controls my sweat and oil well enough i have bination skin or than moisturizer you re using what or heavy moisturizers would u remend or what or bb cushions would u remend for crazy humid wear every single day pls help ps love your videoi love know you took account or people might not have dry skin and you really tired product i have dry skin so i will stay away and any way i think color is way to light for me thanks by way i am new to your channel so far been liking your vidswhat kind of sunscreen do you use during hot summers most of sunscreens i used drugstore is very sticky and gets all over my clos any remendationsnot a difference in color xd difference is anor racedoes it have good coverage is a really great first impressions i m really pale and would love to try product out but normally palest shades of face makeup are still too dark on me so i m worried it ll be same cushion too but if it weren t for i know i would buy producthi morgan i try product and it s really a downside cushion for me even though i have oily bination skin cushion still perform dry patches in my chin area even after i moisture my skin kiehl s ultra facial cream product don t do what it suppose to do my favorite is still laneige bb cushion or etude house any cushionbut does it stay white for long isn t it supposed to oxydised sorry don t know how to write it lol french here cause my skin has a honey type of colour a bit like you and i don t want to look too white i can try to add bronzer but i don t want to do an overdone look especially for school please tell it s just lighting makes it look soooooo paleare cushion foundations in a powder form or is it like a mousse foundation i couldn t tell videoyou should really do a review for laneige bb cushion it really does wonders for my bination skin and it has a nice natural finishwhich is better innisfree or etudehave you tried laneige cushion foundation it s slightly moisturizing but i really like it despite my oily skin also has a 50 spf color was too light it makes you look ashy you should try lane miracle cushion it reaaaally works on dry skin peeps i have medium tanned skin nc40 and i was sooo happy cushion makeup in my skin color exists xdsorry to hear you didn t have such a great experience it is more for bination or oily skin for dry skin it s more remended to take water glow one hope maybe you can try one day thank you for do giving it a fair try trying it different ways it does last all day on me too'\n",

look like little freckles on me lol but n again y get sooo annoyingsend me like rni think product is more likely for exfoliation lol still enjoyed videohi dots on your nose aren t blackheads it s just sebaceous filament don t remove too much oil or sebum or your skin will sta over produce oil which in turn will give you real blackheads honestly little dots on your nose will never go away you can reduce appearance of m temporarily but do not squeeze or press on m to expell sebum all will do is allow your pores to be exposed to air which and open hole will collect di oil and dead skin causing pimples blackheads let your skin be skin dots are normalfei your skin looks amazingsebum sebum jaebumyour nailsthose nails thohey remeber net neutrality1 24 is stain of pepto bismol monster still on

of applicationwhat lip you was wearing is it pony s no make upi love your review i do wonder how many ounces has pared to a regular liquid foundation i feel like se panies are laughing it up all way to bank because customer loves packaging meanwhile you don t get as much product for priceily eddiei don t even know why but every time i watch a video of edward i kind of turn into a starring fish mouth i normally do random shit while i m on youtube but his stuff i just keep starring what is it explainwhat are your thoughts on non tattooing climate in south korea does make sense to you how open people are towards or body modifications like plastic surgerywonhowhy do you not like your freckles you drew some back over your makeup or day lolyou looks so good make up and i love light skin but sometimes i think why did you need all your natural skin looks so good too i mean okay you have acne but you looks still so good i m european and looks like a old red painted potatoare re any cushions in u s i can t find anor than wet and wild and its not color i need for my hella pale skin tonemost thorough and enteaining foundation review i ve ever seen you re so funny and you seem like you re a lot of fun i don t wear foundation but i m looking for one to even out my skin tone for special occasions won t get one thanks to your review thanks so muchsuper oily i didnt like iti normally have found innisfree cushions tend not to last very long i have tried water glow and longwear cushions y look pretty for 4 5 hours but later y look like a dry mess over my pores also make my blush and highlight look patchy does happen cushionlol its same at innisfree in malaysia but its kinda pricey in terms of currencyi use porcelein in l oreal true match foundation but one is a little to dark for me so would korean shade 21 or 23 match medoes anyone know what shade does he usewhenever i use a bb cream after like 1 hour my t zone tend to have oil and i sometimes wear my glasses and it leaves a mark on my nose ughhh hate it when it happens i have never found a very good foundation yet it soos my sensitive skin still looking for it t t any remendations i will appreciated it xdi thought he made a cushion brand or something since title says my cushion why i am so stupid'\n",

you twomary lou manizer is so good yes i love it but i also love cindy lou manizer more pink red highlighter and use it in place of blush on apples of my cheeks n create a gradient w mary lou as my highlight cindy lou also doubles as a super pretty eyeshadow idk how much y would be in korea probably fairly expensive im guessing but if you re able can afford to buy both i would really remend itwhich foundation method was eddy talking aboutjoan looks so pretty her eyes looks like iu her lip looks like sunny snsd her entire looks like lee jong suk lucky heri m sitting here watching video

your candid video and even if you felt like you were just putting on makeup it was still a lot of fun and you gave genuine reactions also i was dying at your makeup when you went to etude house

guys look like siblingswhy does joan remind me of jessi rapper idk just here thoahahaahahahahahhahaha40 for palette is really such a waste its not woh it or even interesting15 53 ya know what else is three dollars chainjoan please teach me your eyeliner ways omfcan i have yr hair plesi know habit is bad but in needed situations i use my paint brushes as eyeshadow brushes but i do clean m properly before and after using it on my eyes and or for countour i cannot even imagine myself like 5 make up brushes let alone 15 special brushes for each pa of my face responsibility is not up for mei d probably buy big palette casing only and slap some or shit i already have in re lol but i love idea of making your own custom paletteme and youtube may be related my last name is his last nameso it s like a z palette but limited xp aha it s funny because i don t get overwhelmed or surprised at your long ass vids but i actually set aside time to where i can properly focus and watch m e avila stan xddid you guys choose based on colors curated for your skin tone autumn warm winter cool etc sorry if you mention it later in video was just curious as i was watchingwhen i go to s korea will you guys adopt me im looking for a fun and loving family edward can be my daddy not kinky way ya ll nasties and joan can be my mum and aoora can be my uncle20 makeup challenge plis hehelmao on joan s shi is verrater written which probably should mean verr ter which means betrayer edit or verrated i can t really see it which mean betrayedmy right eyelid is always like so weird and uneven it has two folds and it s so annoying i ve been trying to do like a lash eyelid glue thing and it helps a lot but weirdly lately since i ve been sleeping on my left side my left eye went hooded asian eye to a more full double eyelid it is useful for bolder makeup but it makes me look like a different person so idk if i like itidk about anyone else but for 39 dollars s a good price you get pallet and units which are good quality type of money at sephora you can get like anything smaller than a pallet itself which in my opinion is ridiculous but hey i m not an expei think it has a decent price if you pare it anor single eyeshadow like mac makeup geek or new pressed powder colourpop y both around 5 6 each i like innisfree empty palette better cause it has a mirror and not looking so bulky like z palette and yeah i think innisfree is cheaper too it s always cost more if you want to build ur own palette but i like to build my palette better cause sometimes i always didn t use all colors an eyeshadow palette i bought such as too face chocolate bar or naked palette'\n",

      " 'what about innisfree s water glow cushion vs laneige s bb cushion i have dry bi skin and live in humid singaporei like iope hera verite laneige s package it all looks beautiful but too bad y all have glow finish which make me looks more oily and i think im going to buy innisfree since have super oily skin and dont mind pact thank you for video finally i know what cushion im going to buy even still i want to have amore pasific s pack 3your innisfree cushion is tone 21 or 23 iope one is really goodim not sure if you know when cushion is getting dry and you feels like product not ing out much use clean finger tools to pick up cushion and you ll see quite alot of bb cc cream foundation still at bottom just flip it over and u can use it longer dit s pronounced lah nehge it s french for snowwhat is lasting power for se products like how many hours for each great review btwi absolutely love bb cushions too thanks for parison tutoriali live in singapore too but i dislike innisfree one i felt like it was cakey sticky and suffocating my skin and i seriously pat on only a really really thin layer maybe it s just me i wanted to try laneige one but i m afraid it will turn out samewhat shades did you get for bothgreat review if i have oily skin bination and i need a lot of coverage which one will u remendwhat was shade in innisfree one againi wanna give laneige one a go soon seems like a lot of people have been saying good things about ithi roseanne i m wondering do you have oily eyelids if you do do you know high end and drugstore eyeliner long wearing doesn t smear at all i know how humid singapore is so i think best person to ask is you thank youhey i was just wondering if you know how long cushions innisfree one esp last for dthanks for review demo but i was wondering do you powder over itfinally i ve found se 2 bb cushions review in one video d you said it will last longer if you put foundation after bb cushion can i know what brand it is thanks for your review it helps me so much to pick one of se d s very helpfuli actually hated innisfree one it made my acne scars stand out and it did not at all control my face oils it was cakey and cheap im going to try laneige pore control most bb cushions are still supposed to have a dewy finish despite being matte because having dewy skin is big thing in korea matte just means it wont make excess oil and is safe for oily skin people to usethanks for your review i m considering in buying which one of m and your review helps a lotdo it blend well if i put primer first before using laneige because i have very oily skin but i need bigger coveragemay i know what are prices for mgreat review thanksbetween innisfree and etude house i wonder which suits best for oily skinomg i bought wrong one n i bought innisfree one but i have dry skin and acne u uactually laneige one you have already is new formula as it is pore control one and it claims it can hold longer pare to older formulagreat review and remendation i have never heard of it before are y good for aging skin if i understood do y work as a primer i have oily skin as well as aging so do you think it would be good for me or which one do you think would work best thank you roseannethanks for helpful reviewi cringed every time she said laneige it means snow in french great review thoughcan wear powder on top and still touch bb trough out day i read a review said sojust what i need thank you very much for paring se two in detailhei babe where can i get innisfree in sgnice review i purchased both hahaexcuse me for saying you are way too pale makeup look like ghost i know cushion evens out skin and create a glowy look but it doesn t work on you i think you should try foundation or bb cream a warmer shade trust me is too pale look really scary on cameramy skin is kind of oily in tzone only so i tried laneige snow bb cushion already whole face turns out so perfect but after i remove makeup i got acne back on my chin and nose what product should i use my skin is only oily in tzone and or pas are so dry outi think im gonna have to try out both during spring summer i am more oily bination skin during fall winter i am dry to bination skin i have never tried a bb cream before so video helped on letting me know differencedid any of you used a pieu air fit cushion foundation i want to get it but i m hesitatingplease do a perfume collection 2014yay makeup for singaporean wearis it tone laneuge tone and innisfree tone 21 or 23 or 13i hv very sensitive skin which one do you remendhi lovely video but laneige is meant to be pronounce la nae ji not lae ni ejihi thank you for review can you please tell me what s your nail colourwhy don t you use innisfree one on your t zone oily area and laneige one on your skin s on dry sidewait nc30 using 21 lol i m nc25 and i use shade 23 and it can even be too light phey which do u remend if i have an oily t zone and acne prone on my chin area only thanks btw is used as a base or can be applied like foundationdear what color you get for innisfree onethank you roseanne for detailed review it s really helpful love your videowhere do you buy bb cushions and how much i wanna try laniege pore control but y dont have it at targetthank you for reviewing it now i know which to buyi have acne prone and oily skin but slightly dry if i choose laneige bb cushion pore control did it make my acne breakout look patchy or crack i have read laneige bb cushion pore control is semi matte so i wonder if it can make my skin moist but less oily thankyou if you mind to give your preferencedo try out iope air sulwhasoo hera bb cushions heard great things about m and would love a review you dthanks for review sulwhasoo have really good ones coverage i m using laneige one and i love it am thinking of getting or brands ones too amazing thing is amore pacific case are all universal can just buy refills to trysorry if you said in video already but what is shade of laneigedo you remember what lip color you re wearing in video love shade on you laneige bb gave me a white overcast boogreat review very detaileddo you wash spongedo you still like face shop aura bb chusion how s coverage pare to laneige onegreat video what s name of background musiclaneige bb cushion how long it last for foundation inside to refill pactyour skin looks so much betterla nae ge not ni hun 3hi in your opinion do you think loose powder is needed to set or is just putting on bb cushion by itself finewhat lip are you wearingwhat are shades of your bb cushionsare re any bb cushions for tan skini am obsessed bb cushions too have you tried one etude house i love one it feels like cool water on skin at a much lower price than laneige onewhere did you buy innisfree cushioni want to try kind of product for a long time but worry about sponges because i have very sensitive acne prone skin sponge applicator is washable so its not bad but sponge actually holds foundation feel like putting foundation a 2 months old beauty blender never washeddo you need to put power after using bb cushion thankshi roseann was wondering if laneige bb cushion or rachel k cc cream renew which i ve been using has better coverage also i love rachel k renew one because it looks so natural and people can barely tell i m wearing makeup does laneige bb cushion give same finish thanksi have oily skin which cushion should i try thanks in advancecan you tell me how did you treat acne on your skin because now your skin is better than i hope you can help mewhere did you buy pore control bb cusion laniegethanks for review just wondering your laneige bb cushion is in blue packaging right is it for pore control not normal bb cushion and may i know which shade are you using for both bb cushion thank youi loved video could you tell me what shade you have cushions in thanksi ve never been a big fan of korean beauty stuff until i became a mentor for a korean trainee recently i am pretty happy tae foudation and use it all time one day i wanted to give innisfree cushion a try since re is a huge innisfree store right next to my m station and my trainee talked about it all time you know i hated it and only until today i ve got to know answer it made all lines on my under eyes area appear and show all pores on top of my nose while rest of face are acceptably covered my skin type is bination due to long working hours in sales i need to wear makeup like 10 hours daily but i rarely have acnes or break out why didnt i realize earlier its remended for oily skin thanks so much for video you made my day dhave you trued etude house bb cushion is good do you have review video of itim just back seoul innisfree s long wear cushion had discontinued y told me y are implementing a better long wear cushion bb it will be out early junei just bought long wear cushion innisfree and i can t wait to try it out after watching your vid i m kinda having some expectations since i ve acne prone oily skin and stays in singapore too thanks for vid roshi la neige is really french for snow not korean hahagreat review if you can would love for you to try out iope and sulwahsoo curious on what you thinki was waiting for kind of video for longest time if i have oily nose and t zone but normal skin on my face which do you remend laneige bb cushion innisfree long wear or innisfree water glow i only need a little converge thoughhi what make up remover do you suggest to remove foundation bb i m having edones using cleansing oil and am thinking of getting a replacement will bioderma do job thank youthanks a lot for ur review it does help a lot cause i was planning to try out laneige n innisfree cushion after i finish iope cushion sure u gotta try on iope cushion cause y give u a non oily shine glow skin just as same as korean idol we saw in korea drama now i know should buy innisfree long wear cause few of se day singapore really very hot for surehey just curious isn t it filled bacteria after a while because sponge es in contact our sweat especially if we use it for touch ups and despite washing it we dip diy sponge back into th email cushion so cushion is moist and dark get what i m trying to say i ve been meaning to try it but i m scared i ll get breakouts i m in kl thanksguys i hated innisfree one firstly itgets diy easily because its white ugly packaging and also because it broke me out real bad coverage was too notch id give m but its not even matte to me breaking out pa made me eventually dump it before finishing itit looks like you ve put on a ton of product and it s staing to look slightly cakey'\n",

pretty imi would loovee to see you do a make up tutorial on effy skins or kaya scodelario i think you look like her a bitlove your honesty brand i think ir skincare is far better than ir makeup off topic question i didn t see answered anywhere your gold bracelet is exquisite where did you get itinnisfree is my favorite korean brand 3innisfree is my fav korean brand along face shop and is not a biased opinion it has nothing to do products but is my fav one brand tutorial of yours u always look stunning but i think look really suits u please do face shop later onhave you tried isehan heroine super waterproof mascara technically it s japanese but i can t remember if you ve mentioned it beforehi what s use of nosebum powdergreat video i loved closeups so much better than some or video as views just are not as good plus she didn t spend too much time speaking or applying it went fast now i am older in my 60 s i realize i need a primer before i put on base but now i guess i need a translucent powder after base i will try innisfree products is 2nd video a different person and i like one much betterwhich powder brush are you usingcan you do a video about makeup brushes thank you luv yahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhi ve used innisfree long wear cushion and i just can t stand smell of sunscreen in foundation and it just lasts so long i get really annoyed by smell for a whole day does anyone have same problemhi morgan i m using etude collagen cushion and faces cushion but both seem to be cracking on my face i tries missha consiler eye base as well but is cracking also what i can doawesome video is out on my birthday my favorite brandcan you make a video for beginners on how to apply eyeshadow and like easy colors for beginnerswhere did you get headbandall i have to say is if you do not like innisfree just do not do such video you are so freaking rude to people who actually like brand it is just your own prblem your skin does not suit se products it is just like many people cannot use etude house as well refore be cautious about what you say is why you do not have many subscribersqdhi morgan now it s getting warmer do you have any sunblock remendations i m using innisfree eco safety sunblock like one you used in video just spf50 version i feel like same about it as you do it s just okay do you have favorite sunblocks'\n",

love you and your denim jacket where d u get it also ur video aestic in is giving me iu palette vibes hahahhye joan i don t know why you didn t like pyunkang yul moisturiser may be because you have dry skin but to be honest you i love ir moisture cream because it changed my skin color red to normal n for moisture i think moisturiser is a protective layer for ur applied moisture or hydration level so if u want moisture to last long n you should apply good level of hydrating layer and n apply a good layer or moisturiser and i hv oily to dehydrated skin n ir moisture cream is enough for me i think n may i ask you a question is re any need of any moisturiser to look moisturising it should feel like it is giving a good moisture leveli think liese is pronounced liesay is me going off as

7 whitehead liquid make it dissapear hope u answer it thxi am finding cheap and easy use eye shadow for beginners any suggestioni bought pyunkang moisture cream after i saw your video visiting ir store it isn t bad but i don t have dry skin so i guess s whyfor some reason cosrx broke me out more than ever before i never had any white heads on my forehead or my cheeks but cosrx really made me break outi ve used centella blemish cream of cosrx and it doesn t seem to work on me been using it for two months trying to make it work but whenever i put it on my protruding zits or those are just new y will bee bigger next day or will have pus also clogged pores causing blackheads love ir or products thohi joan i think maybe pyunkang yul cream felt a little bit weird because i think ir ingredients are targeted for skins atopic dermatitis i want to order it for my sister since she has condition and i have read good review about it i love your review thank youhey joan i love all your video i have a question i m 27 yrs old and have dehydrated oily skin oily on top yet very tight and unfoable and i m using sulwhasoo essential balancing emulsion and it seems to be really hydrating my

      " 'penasaran bgt sama bija cica balm innisfree dari liat review2 udah tearik bgt tapi masih nabung huhu jerawatku selalu muncul kalau lagi haid dan selalu dibagian pipi bekasnya susahhh bgt hilang dan belum selesai hilang bekas jerawat yang lama udah muncul jerawat baru gitu aja teruskulitku tipe normal ke berminyak terutama daerah t zone dan sering muncul jerawat kalo stress atau ga bersihin wajah sebelum tidur cara mengatasi kulit adalah nonton video kak vero kalo kulit berminyak kita cuci mukanya terlalu sering atau lama malah akan membuat kulit tambah berminyak krn kulit pikir kekurangan minyak krn kering setelah cuci muka maka kulit akan memproduksi minyak lebih banyak trs setelah tau itu mulai palai moisturazer yaitu aloe vera dr nature republic dan saem setiap hari dan hasilnya adalah minyak di wajah ga separah dulu jadi balance aja kulitnya karena masih kuliah jd identik dengan kata stress nah jd sering muncul jerawat jerawat yang di dalamnya ada nanah krn jika nanahnya pecah nanti akan menimbulkan bekas jerawat yg merah dan menghitam jd pakai bio oil untuk mengatasi bekas jerawat urutan skincarenya adl micelar water facial wash scrub 2x seminggu moisturaizer klo malem pake night cream abis itu baru bio oilmuk oily skin sensitif jadi gak ada waktu istirahat buat kulit muk untuk bagus pengen nyoba ini dari satu bulan yg lalu karna reviewnya yng bagus and i love inisfree product so muchhh selalu cocok pakai inisfree suka rangkaian orchid dan green teanya berharap dapet sample ini for much better skin barrierkak ini seriusan bkn endora atau apa trua skrg kk masih pake gak inihaii jd sebelumnya mau ksh tau jenis kulit normal to oily skin sensitive acne prone jd mslh kulit itu jrwt yg sering muncul di area rahang gak tau knp di area rahang muncul jrwt terus dibandingkan area wajah yg lain apalagi saat mau mens jrwt langsung muncul lumayan byk yg perhatiin dibagian area rahang lumayan byk whitehead jd mgkn ini salah satu alasan knp area rahang menjadi tmpt tumbuhnya jrwt krn kulit gk cck sama tea tree smoga bija ini cocok utk ngatasin jrwt ini pny mslh dlm pemilihan pelembab kalau salah pakai pelembab kulit langsung berminyaakkk otomatis jrwt makin banyak iya segitu sensintifnya jd hrs picky dlm milih pelembab utk jenis kulit kayak wish me luck smoga bs menang n cobain produk innisfree bija cica balmyey video baru ce veyo team gercepsuper duper penasaran sama ini soalnya sering liat di thread kalo innisfree bija cica balm bagus banget apalagi kalo di pakai satu setnya cuma ya itu harganya tidak tercapai tapiii setelah liat ini astaga salah satu youtuber favoriteku ngereview jadi tambah ingin masih struggles banget sama bekas jerawat bruntusan dan tekstur kulit sampai hari ini kalau cece bilang itu bagus buat ngebenerin damage yang di kulit harap ini juga bisa di i ve been struggling to acne dari sma gapernah tu ada yang namanya sehari tanpa jerawat muk udah rajin maskeran pake ini itu ehh malah tambah parah jerawatnya udah gituu nanti bekasnya suka timbul gitu jadi ga pede gituu kalau mau fotoan dan bikin ketergantungan bgt sama makeup belum lagi kalau di komen 2 ttg jerawat suka bikin down hope

update skin care rutin nya donk pagi malam plisssshey everyone as alwaysso excited kulit ku di jidat dan hidung sampai ke bawah mata berminyak parah bgt sampe kayanya kalau di kumpulin bisa di ekspor terus sampai pake bedak aja gaakan tahan lama gitu beda bgt sama kulit di pipi ku yang kering bgt sampe kadang ngelupas dan acne prone parah nih daerah pipi sudah coba banyak produk dan sering bgt nyesel karena udah nabung keras sampe ga jajan buat beli tapi eh taunya makin memperparah keadaan jerawat yang memang sudah beahun tahun betah bgt di wajah dan bekas jerawat kalau di muka ku itu kaya lamaaaaaa bgt bisa ilang nya mana warnanya merah kaya jerawat jadi bener bener ga bisa pake blush on tuh soalnya percuma gitu belum lagi di idung dan jidat tengah ku pori porinya besar jadi berkomedo dan di jidat kadang bruntusan dan akhir akhir ini si idung ikut ikutan bermasalah sebel banget dehh mungkin karena nyusun skripsi adalah hal yang berat dan kulit ku bermaslah udah dari sd kelas 6 sampe sekarang udah mau lulus kuliah kebayang ga tuh masalah ku ga beres beress udah pernah ke dokter juga sekitar setahunan lah tapi ga tega sama ou yang bayarin jadi berhenti dan ternyata makin

kalau ada prodak yang terbilang mudah di dapat dan bisa buat wajah ku mendingan pasti temen temen ku semuanya ngikut deh wkkwwk dan semoga bisa menang giveway ini dan kulitku makin baik aamiinkalian jgn pakai yg aneh2 mmg rasa penasaran kita berleboh tetapi dicoba untuk menahan diri walaupu branded tetapi belum tentu cocok di kulit masing2 manusia usahakan pakai pencuci muka yg benar2 cocok setiap mau tdr pakai melanox ke seluruh wajah bisa menghilangkan jerawat tpi sabar hasilnya manjur yg penting telaten aja harganya 31rb di apotik sebenernya penyebab jerawat itu kebanyakan karena kulit kita sudah tipis sudah terkontaminasi oleh kosmetik2 sebelumnya struggling banget sama breakout udah mau tiga minggu karena mungkin lagi stress banyak pikiran ya udah coba produk ini itu jerawat nya kempes tapi bekasnya itu susah banget ilangnya dan baru tau kalau innisfree punya bija cica balm ini dan liat video kaka wow ternyata iya perubahannya keliatan banget sih dark spots nya jauh berkurang maka dari itu tearik pengen coba innisfree bija cica balm inihai kak kulit ku ini tipe yang berminyak dan mudah jerawatan dan jerawatnya suka muncul terus dan yang paling susah diilangin adalah bekas jerawatnya jerawatan parah di kelas 8 dan bekasnya super parah banyak banget sekarang kelas 12 dan bekas jerawatnya blm memudar bahkan gak ada perubahan dari dulu sampe sekarang masih suka searching cara menangani bekas jerawat diy dan beberapa produk yang direkomendasikan juga gak mempan bahkan pernah nabung buat beli masker yang katanya bisa ngilangin bekas jerawat karena banyak org yang berhasil menghilangkan bekas jerawat yg pake produk itu tapi apa gak ada perubahan sampe komplen ke owner dan ownernya marah ke dan minta pake maskernya rutin selama 2 tahun setelah pemakaian

vero wish me luckpengen nangis kalo ngaca uda beahun2 jerawat dan bekas2nya ga mau ilanggg ngeliat temen2 disekolah yang mukanya uda membaik padahal dlunya jerawatan tpi masih struggle belum lgi beberapa hari lagi mau balek kampung dan semua keluarga besar ngumpul disana gabisa bayangin semalu apa nnti pas uda lama ga ketemu tiba2 pas ketemu muka uda parah t t pengen banget punya kulit mulus ga usah mulus ga ada jerawat dan bekasnya aja uda syukurjadii perjuangan itu masalahnya di jerawat horminal dan bekas jerawat dua hal ini ditanganinya pun dengan hal yg berbedaa untuk jerawat hormonal paling susah karena harus pilih pilih makanan yang yang bisa nyebabin jerawat dan trigger food itu produk diary chocolate terus cabee dan juga telorr apalagi mii susah bangett milih makanan yg gaada mereka tapi uhhh dengan perjuangan sepenuh hati ikhlas dan juga masa bodo aja intinya jangan dipikirin jerawat hormonal yg tadinya cuma isi whiteheads tapi bengkak gitu jadi ga inflamasi lagi dan untuk hilangin bekas jerawatnya mengandalkan skincare yg mengandung aha tapi ga tiap hari coyyy muk iritasii jadi pake aha juga perlu mastiin kondisi muka dulu sedang baik baik saja atau tidaaa sekiranya tida tida akan memaksakan muk untuk itu walaupun suka manfaat aha ini karena emang bener buat ngilangin bekas jerawat tapi ga boleh sering pakenyaa bisa rusakk skin barrier u sekiaann kak

jeju orchid sleeping mask ka dikulit sy berminyak sensitif dan gampang berjerawat cocok bangeeet kalo yg versi dluu mengandung arbutin nah yg terbaru ini adaa kandungan niacinamide nya teksturnya jugaa agak thick lumayan melembabkan dan juga bagus untuk anti aging baunya jg enak hahahaha kalo yg innisfree aloe revital sleeping pack juga bagussss nah kalo yg aloe vera ini cuma untuk melembabkan ajaa teksturnya enak bangeet kayak cream tp bukan cream hahaha pas dipakai dikulit lsg jd kyak air seger dan efek melembabkankan juga lumayan tp menurutku utk efek melembabkannya bagusan yg orcid hehehe nah terus sy juga pernah coba yg laneige water sleeping mask yg udah banyaaaaaak banget yg cobain hahahhaa tp sayang dikulit ga cocok peama pakai lsg merah2 kulit karna kalo tanda sy ga cocok sama suatu produk kulit lsg merah2 pakai malam trs pas besok pagi lsg dibilang dan merah2nya juga masih adaa utk bau sih b ajaaa masih enakkan yg innisfree hahaha segeeer untung beli kemasan travel size jd ga rugi2 amat hahahaha ya namanya skincare jg cocok2an tp kebanyakan kulit sy cocok sih dgn produk innisfree innisfree yg seri jeju calamus itu juga bagus bangeeeet yg cleansing gel dan foam nya hahahaa wajib banget dicobaaa maaaf kaa komennya jd panjang banget hahahahaha sama kak juga kalo beli produk yang katanya bagus buat brightening atau pore care gitu semangat bgt pakenya dan kalo itu produk g cocok rasanya kayak g mau percaya gitu masak g cocok sih dan sampai berkali kali di coba namun hasilnya tetep bikin break out in end yasyudah di pre loved sajakak toner some by me donknovi coba rivew innisfree chrerry tone upka bandingin dong innisfree whitening pore cream vs innisfree bija cica balm yang paling ampuh buat tekstur ngeratain warna kulit jerawat makasihh ka ditungguini di cocok bgt alhamdulillah tiap bangun tidur kulit kerasa lembah bgt dan halus bekas2 jerawat juga pudar dan gak bikin bruntusan malah ngilangin bruntusan trnyata tergantung kulit tiap org ya cocok engga nya produk itusama kaya ka gk cocok pake yang itu bikin wajah bruntusan parah udah gitu harganya mahal pulakaya nya sama kaya mba nya niih kulit saya jg jd agak bruntusan dan timbul beberapa jerawat tp masih diterusin siih mdh2an cuma adptasi kulit soal nya udh beli mahal2 kn sayangwah sama kk jerawatan bruntusan waktu pake sleeping pack tapi aq pake yg punyanya laneige katanya sih bagus tapi di kulitku malah nimbulin reaksi yg enggak udah pake ini sekitar 2 bulan waktu awal2 pake emang kyk ada rasa perih dikit ditambah merah2 gitu disekitar pipi tapi trs pake nah lama2 dibagian bawah mata sebelah hidung itu kulit jd kasar kering banget trs sempet berhenti dulu buat pake laneige biar gakering dibagian bawah mata itu nah trs lanjut lagi akhirnya kulit baru mau adaptasi jadi sampe skrg pake tiap malem dan kulit gaada masalah lg ya walaupun gaterlalu berpengaruh sih buat ngurangin pori dan whitening nya cmn yg rasain pas bangun itu kulit jd lembab trs halus aja gitu trs sedikit glowing cuman setelah pake ini tmn2 sering tanya pake skincare apa soalnya kulit itu keliatan berminyak tp pas dipegang gaminyakan jd so far cocok2 ajasama kok yaa aq juga pake trus jd jerawatan terus pdhal biasanya cm jerawan bulanan aja n ga banyak tp stelah pake produk ini kok muncul trus2an akhirnya aq istirahat in dlu kulit nya utk tau apa bisa kembali lg kulit aq yg tadinya baik2 aja nah sekarang stlah udh mulai normal lg ga kapok aq lg mulai coba lg nih bbrapa hari ini tp di siasatin stelah pake pembersih toner viva bengkoang dan dilanjutkan sm face wash ponds yg anti acne baru deh aq pakein produk ini sblum tidur dan setelah bngun segera cuci lg dgn face wash yg sama nah utk hasilnya smpe bbrapa hr ini sih blm ada tnda2 jerawatan lg d tp efek baiknya jg blm ada juga pake aloe vera innisfree langsung jerwat besaar parah deh pokoknya untung murah kalau lebih cocok produk produk dr nature republic drpada innisfree gatau kenapa cuma sebagian yg bagus kaya orchid gel cream juga bagus di tp gatau tt mau beli produk lain soalnya trauma jerawat besar dan lama ituu 6 bulanan jerawatanduh sayang banget gak cocok jadi ragu nih padahal pengen beliklo
